Documentation for GitHub Portfolio Site

This documentation explains the process of creating a GitHub portfolio site using the provided HTML code.

Prerequisites:
- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Git

Steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking on the "New" button on the main page of your account.
2. Give the repository a name of your choice, and choose the option "Public" or "Private".
3. Initialize the repository with a README file, and create a new branch called "gh-pages".
4. Clone the repository to your local machine using the Git command: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git`
5. Copy the provided HTML code and paste it into a new file called "index.html" in the root directory of your local repository.
6. Create a new folder called "assets" in the root directory of your local repository, and create two subfolders inside it: "css" and "img".
7. Download the "styles.css" file from the provided HTML code and save it in the "assets/css" folder.
8. Download the "logo.png" and "fav.ico" images from the provided HTML code and save them in the "assets/img" folder.
9. Commit your changes using the Git commands:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```
10. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to deploy your website. You can check if it's live by visiting the URL `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/` in your web browser.

Congratulations! You have now created a GitHub portfolio site using the provided HTML code. You can customize the site by editing the HTML and CSS files, and by adding your own content and images to the "assets" folder. Remember to commit your changes and push them to the "gh-pages" branch to update your website.
